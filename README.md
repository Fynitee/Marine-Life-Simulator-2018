# Marine-Life-Simulator-2018

[JAVA] This is a simulator created to represent a marine ecosystem for a class project.
It's meant to inform and educate others about the trophic levels and the influences of
surrounding environmental factors, such as predator, prey, and pollution, onto the ecosystem.

Note the music wasn't imported as well (has the file name "ocean.wav") as it was too big.
